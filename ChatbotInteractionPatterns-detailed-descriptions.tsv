pattern nr.	pattern title	Situation	Intention	Implementation
Pattern 1	Chat Messages	Visually displaying the conversation between the chatbot and user.	Offering presentation of the sender of conversational content, which is separated into thematic or task-based section to make it easier and more intuitive for the user to follow.	Text is usually shown in speech bubbles which are separated in a different colour than the background, media content is mostly posted separate and both are visually aligned to the chatbot or the user on the left or right of the interface.
Pattern 2	Cards	Presenting items with the same functionalities in a consistent form. Cards can be posted either singular or as a collection (see Pattern 3).	Providing a similar presentation form of actionable content both for traditional pop-up and screen-wide chatbot web interfaces.	Combining either text or an image with at least one button for different actions. The layout of Cards can be customized to the content.
Pattern 3	Carousel	Presenting a set of similar items, often as Cards (Pattern 2).	Offering the option to browse when different options are presented without using too much space in the interfaces.	The items are displayed in a horizontal list which can be navigated by scrolling or arrow buttons.
Pattern 4	Quick Replies	When users should answer from a set of possible commands which can be selected as a reaction to a chatbot message (Pattern 1).	Providing a set of actions or functionalities either as possible next steps in the conversation or to offer help.	Buttons under the last chatbot message, which can also replace free text input. Usually change after being clicked as if sent as message by user.
Pattern 5	Typing Indicators	A visual representation of waiting time for the reply of the chatbot.	Giving feedback on time consuming computation processes and to let the users feel more comfortable in the conversation.	Usually three dots which are known from messengers and will then dynamically change to the finished chat message (Pattern 1).
Pattern 6	Persistent Menu	Included when important functionalities, a FAQ, or settings should always be available for the users.	Providing users a persistent access to important functionalities.	The access, often as a burger menu, should be located near or directly beside the text input field or in the chatbot header.
Pattern 7	Call-on Menu	Providing help for users if they are asking about specific commands or the chatbot cannot understand their request.	They help if users need assistance on functionalities unavailable via the persistent menu (Pattern 6), or may not know how to access them.	"Either as chat messages (Pattern 1) with explanations or command templates, tutorials with graphics, or as quick replies (Pattern 4); the presentation is depending on the specific request from the users."
Pattern 8	Webview	Adds content from other providers or the same homepage.	Provide content which does not make sense to implement in the chatbot itself, like a playable preview for videos or a route on a map.	Including component which enables previews on web content.
Pattern 9	Message Reactions	Include this pattern to get feedback from users on the correctness of the provided answer from the chatbot.	Gives the users the feeling to influence and improve the chatbot, but also the option to display their dissatisfaction.	Include greyed out emojis, usually thumbs-up and thumbs-down, beside or underneath the chat message which will change shape or colour after being clicked.
Pattern 10	Help Systems	Offering assistance for users if they are faced with complicated tasks or are unsure on how to proceed.	They provide guidance and assurance to users and can help in avoiding conversation breakdowns if the user does not recognize the limits of the chatbot functionalities. The scope and presentation depends on the specific situation.	"Can be implemented by using Persistent or Call-on menus (Patterns 6 and 7), Functionality Introduction (Pattern 11), or Quick Replies (Pattern 4); some of which can be seen in Figure \ref{figHelp}."
Pattern 11	Functionality Introduction	The user should know from the beginning which functionalities the chatbot offers and how they can formulate requests in chat messages.	Avoiding conversation breakdowns or disappointing expectations which the users might have from previous interactions with other chatbots.	Use the first chat messages (Pattern 1)  to introduce main functionalities and/or guide through a tutorial with graphics.
Pattern 12	Conversation Recovery	Avoiding conversation breakdowns by offering the user assistance for their request.	Provides the user with possible ways forward if they are not understood (even without explicitly asking for help) which can reduce dissatisfaction.	"Instead of only providing a chat message that the original request was not understood (""I am sorry, I do not understand""), additionally provide either Quick Replies (Pattern 4) or a Call-on Menu (Pattern 7)."
