# Chatbot-Interaction-Patterns - Online Appendix

This is the online appendix of the submitted paper "Interaction Design Patterns of Web Chatbots" for ICWE 2024.

The repository includes the following files:
The lists for the included [chatbot functionalities][funct] and the [interaction design patterns][pat], both including the descriptions for the categories 'Situation', 'Intention' and 'Implementation', which were compared in the mapping process. The descriptions for the interaction design patterns were summarized for easier handling by ChatGPT (see paper).

Lists with all [chatbot functionalities][funct-compl] and [interaction design patterns][pat-compl], without regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

The result of the mapping process can be found [in this table][results], which only includes the conclusive matches (as can be seen with an '**X**' in the table).

Additional results can be found [in this table][results-ext], where we include conclusive matches (again, marked with '**X**'), but also further information which was outside of the scope for the paper. For a better understanding, we present the results here. When an interaction design pattern can be matched to a chatbot functionality, we marked which other functionalities would be used by this pattern with a '**t**'. On the other hand, if a chatbot functionality was matched with a pattern and this match would make use of other patterns (or rather their equivalents in a chatbot interface), we marked it with an '**O**' in the table. In this table, dependencies between patterns and functionalities are made visible and it also shows that dependencies are going in both directions and as such offer a certain kind of verification for the mapping process.
